Skin Cancer Classification using Vision Transformer
A deep learning approach for classifying skin lesions into four categories using a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture.
Overview
This project implements a Vision Transformer model with 12 layers to classify dermoscopic images of skin lesions. The model distinguishes between four classes—two malignant (cancerous) and two benign conditions.
Dataset
Source: ISIC 2019 + ISIC 2020 Challenge Datasets
The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) datasets provide a large-scale collection of dermoscopic images for skin lesion analysis.
